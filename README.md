## Introduction

Logicbase\_Command is a web-based application developed using modern web technologies. The system comprises a frontend built with React and Next.js, a backend powered by Next.js (App Router), and a MySQL database managed via Aiven Console. For real-time chat functionality, the application integrates **Ably**, a serverless WebSocket platform, to overcome the limitations of Vercel's serverless environment.

## API Documentation

The Logicbase_Command application provides a RESTful API for interacting with the system. Below is the documentation for available endpoints.

**TO BE ADDED**

## Deployment

The application is deployed on **Vercel** and can be accessed at:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://logicbase-command.vercel.app/](https://logicbase-command.vercel.app/)

**Note on Real-Time Functionality**:

Due to Vercel's serverless architecture, traditional WebSocket servers cannot be hosted directly. To implement real-time chat features, **Ably** is integrated as a serverless WebSocket alternative. Ably facilitates real-time messaging without the need for managing dedicated WebSocket servers, ensuring seamless real-time communication within the application.

## Admin Accounts

The application includes predefined admin accounts for testing and administrative purposes:

1. **Existing Admin Account**:

   * **Email**: `logicbase.nazareno@gmail.com`
   * **Password**: `12345678`

2. **Auto-Admin Account**:

   * **Email**: `logicbase.king@gmail.com`
   * **Note**: This account does not exist by default. Upon registration using this email, the account will automatically be assigned admin privileges. The password chosen during registration will serve as the admin password.

## Additional Libraries and Tools

* **FullCalendar**: Integrated for interactive calendar functionalities, supporting various views like day grid and time grid, along with user interactions. This includes:

  * `@fullcalendar/react`
  * `@fullcalendar/daygrid`
  * `@fullcalendar/timegrid`
  * `@fullcalendar/interaction`&#x20;

* **@hello-pangea/dnd**: Utilized for implementing accessible and customizable drag-and-drop features within the application.&#x20;

* **@mui/material**: Employed for building a consistent and responsive user interface following Google's Material Design principles.&#x20;

* **@toolpad/core**: Used to expedite the development of admin panels and internal tools by providing a set of high-level React components.&#x20;
